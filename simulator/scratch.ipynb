    "## There seems to be an issue when the stress is not monotonically increasing. The second element often ends up behind the first and as a result the sim crashes. I am not exactly sure why it is happening but it is clearly related to the boundary condition being imposed on the first element. If I then try to make sure the second element is always beyond the first, the third element goes behind the second. I think the issue is related to the stress on the first element causing a high force since the 0->1 element gets stretched a lot and it may be less than the stress from the 1->2 element. If the active stress is not enough to overcome that, then the second element would move to the left and maybe end up behind the first element. \n",

In that case we would have a large stress from the stretching 0->1 element and if the active stress wasn't enough to overcome it we could end up with the same issue. But whenever I run uniform simulations I don't see that problem (no matter the magnitude of the active stress).\n",
